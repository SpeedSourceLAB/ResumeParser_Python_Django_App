We cover the full stack, so you can start the day fixing a Javascript bug, hack on the API over lunch, and investigate database performance issues before heading home. Or, if you like, take a few days to focus on delivering a small feature that our tens of thousands of customers have been asking for and measuring exactly how often it's being used. This team does it all, so you'll never be bored and you'll constantly be learning new technologies.
Who You'll Work With
You will join a fast paced, multi-talented Engineering team where new features are delivered to customers multiple times a day. We apply our startup culture to tackle the problems of a multi-billion-dollar enterprise business. We have a diverse set of skills, so you'll learn and grow every single day.
Who You Are
You are a Software Engineer that enjoys wearing many hats, a self-starter that's willing to jump headfirst into the codebase and start improving it immediately. This is a true generalist full stack role, so if you've tried a few different web stacks and have your favorites, that's a good sign. Or, if you've got proven middle-tier experience and you're a fast learner, this would be a phenomenal opportunity to branch out. You are passionate about the ""developer experience"" and finding ways to remove friction from the development workflow. You’re happy working in a continuous delivery environment, and reaching out across teams to tackle problems. You are comfortable working in Javascript, as well as working with CI/CD environments and AWS in general.
Our minimum requirements for this role:
* Experience designing, implementing, and supporting a large-scale customer-facing web property or service
* Demonstrable PHP, Python, Java, C++, Golang or JavaScript skills
* Proven skills with modern Javascript (web apps, libraries, CLI apps) and React/Redux
* Experience with CI/CD systems (Jenkins, Concourse)
* Experience with Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, CloudFront, Lambda) and Datastores like DynamoDB, RDS
* Experience with secure coding standard methodologies and remediation
* Experience working in an Agile environment
* Experience building (and supporting) web applications, microservices, and multi-datacenter applications
* In-depth knowledge of object-oriented concepts, programming, and systems design
* Understanding of various design patterns and Service-Oriented Architecture
* Excellent oral and written communication skills
* Excellent analytical and troubleshooting skills
Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re ""old"" (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box!
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Opportunity@Work is a nonprofit social enterprise with a mission to increase career opportunities for the 71 million adults in the U.S. who do not have a four-year college degree but are Skilled Through Alternative Routes (STARs).

We envision a future in which employers hire people based on skills rather than their pedigree.

We do, which is why we're building Patreon, a platform that powers membership services for creators with established followings. Patreon strives to provide creators with insight, education, and tools that make it possible to retain creative control while running their creative business, so creators can focus on creating and energizing their fanbases.

The right candidate for this role will have broad experience with front-end and/or back-end software development and exposure to or experience with the various build systems necessary to ship tested, translated code to production. You should know about CI/CD systems, but you won't be a release engineer/manager since our engineers release their own code. Instead, part of your work will be to understand the automation that makes this possible, and then improve it. Another key part of your work will be to understand the developer experience from inception through deployment to maintenance, and work with engineers across the org to optimize key parts of the development cycle so we can ship code faster without sacrificing reliability, stability, or iteration speed.
 What you will do:
Support Patreon's creative and diverse engineering team by building reliable, thoughtful development tools.

Equip engineers with knowledge and resources so they can learn and understand Patreon's systems.
Refine the build and test tooling for frontend and backend development.
Identify opportunities for building new internal tools and processes, then design and implement solutions.
Collaborate across the engineering team to keep engineers unblocked and productive.
Skills and experience you possess:
Backend and/or frontend development experience (especially on internal tools and developer tools!)
Testing and CI/CD pipelines.
API design.
Exploring and troubleshooting Linux systems.
A desire to teach and share technical concepts with a wide range of experience levels.
Projects you may work on:
CLI and desktop tools for managing dev instances of Patreon services.
Internal Slack bots and status display interfaces.
JS and Python build and test pipelines.
Infrastructure to provision development EC2 instances.
Surveying developer satisfaction and gathering feedback from engineers.
Documentation and training efforts.
What you will have the chance to learn:
Build a wide breadth of generalist full-stack skills: from devops tasks like upgrading the infrastructure developer code runs on to building graphical frontends for developer tools. You'll be exposed to a little bit of everything.
Communicate with and empower developers of a variety of experience levels.
Design and iterate on tools with fast feedback from fellow engineers.
Contribute to open source projects in Patreon's ecosystem.
Learn from, teach, and collaborate with a wide variety of developers and  disciplines.
Who you'll work with:
At Patreon, you'll join a high-performing and highly-empathetic team of people who proudly work on fulfilling our mission of funding the creative class. Our culture of creator-first, thoughtful teammates keeps work creative, stretching, and rewarding.
Our Core Behaviors:
Put Creators First.Patreon is nothing without our creators. 
Achieve Ambitious Outcomes.Set, measure, and accomplish goals that deliver massive value to our creators and patrons. 
Cultivate Inclusion.We want an environment that retains and engages the diverse teams we build.
Bias Towards Action.When in doubt, we take the next best step, then course correct when needed. We go out of our way to fix problems when we see them. We take ownership seriously.
Be Candid and Kind.Be extremely caring and extremely direct in all you do at Patreon, especially when it comes to giving positive and constructive feedback. 
Be Curious. You don’t know it all, and that’s the fun part. Everything gets better when you’re curious. Things get more interesting, more clear, and more approachable. When you bring curiosity into the workplace, you’re growing yourself, your teammates, and Patreon as a whole.

We’re a small team looking to disrupt the $300B+ food and restaurant industry. We care deeply about where our food comes from and how it gets to our plate. We’re building software to make that process more efficient and transparent. Think Flexport for the food service industry, but with bigger margins. 

Almost everyone on the team has prior hospitality space startup experience and senior leadership has had several successful exits as founders themselves. 

You can take a peek at what we’ve been working on at www.cutanddry.com. As you can imagine Covid knocked us and the restaurant industry for a loop but we didn’t stay idle. In March we immediately began working with local partners to spin up market.cutanddry.com, a high-end home grocery delivery service with curated products not available anywhere else in the Bay.

At the outset, these functions may seem like mundane facts-of-life in the process of running a business; however, the skill with which a company does them can have a profound impact not only on their business, but also the world. A poorly forecasted budget, could mean the abrupt end to the clinical trial of a potentially life-saving drug. On the other hand, a highly accurate hiring plan can lead to successful team growth that allows a company to design a brand-new material that helps reverse climate change.

Take pride in your work while upholding best practices in engineering.
Believe that code should be shipped daily.
Enjoy working in high performing teams, which value learning, shared responsibility and moving fast.
Value pragmatism and simplicity and find pleasure in effectively leveraging technology.
What it’s like to work here:
You will have an opportunity to work in an environment where engineering is central to what we do.

We have growth mindsets, not fixed ones
We believe that success lies in execution, not credentials
We act like owners, not just employees
We work to find answers on our own, not wait for them to be given to us
We optimize for mission, not ego
